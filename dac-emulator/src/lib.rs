//! An Ether Dream DAC emulator.
//!
//! The emulator is composed of two primary processes:
//!
//! 1. The **Broadcaster**, responsible for broadcasting over UDP.
//! 2. The **Listener**, responsible for handling connections via TCP as **Stream**s.
//!
//! The DAC components can be created via the **new** constructor which takes a **Description** of
//! the DAC that you wish to emulate.
